### Tools ###

Here's a list of tools I use, if you ever see something cool in a post, chances are it was enabled by one of these.  

#### Blog ####
[Jekyll][jk] - Static site generator, used to make everything look nice.  
[Theme][th] - My stylesheet is 99% from [Ben Ubois][th], which is available along with everything else from the blog's [public repository][self].  

#### Languages ####
[Python][py] - My go-to language for anything and everything, Python 3 is always preferred.  
[Erlang][er] - Massive concurrency and functional bliss, although I'm still learning.  
[Java][ja] - OO for the masses, and sadly me too.  
[C][c] - The language I wish I knew more, and wish I liked more, but I understand pointers so I'm not too sad.  

#### Dev Tools ####
[Git][gt] | [Git-sh][gs] | [Github][gh] - I really like anything git, and these three work in perfect harmony as source control, extended usability, and a project hub.  
[Sublime Text 2][sb] - The almost perfect balance between a minimal text editor and a powerful IDE, plus plugins mean infinite customization.  

#### Other ####
[SpiderOak][sp] - Encrypted cloud storage with syncronization and amazing sharing abilites, I assume this is what Dropbox aspires to.
