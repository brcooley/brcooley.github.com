This being my first post on the [Blogotubes][1], it should both rank high for the search terms "blogotubes" and "probably should go to sleep", of course only if you [quote the query][2].  

Dryness aside, this post is mainly here to mark the date I first pushed this site to github.  [The source][3] is probably fairly uninteresting, and borrows heavily from [Ben Ubois][4].  Going forward, this should serve as a good platform to practice semi-technical writing mixed with prose.  Communication is very important for programmers, and so here's my attempt and getting better at it.  Updates will be sparse, but I'll do my best to either post some form of a tutorial or a status update on one of my projects every month.

I guess I should end with a link to my current [homepage][5].  While perhaps less informative, all the important things are there.
