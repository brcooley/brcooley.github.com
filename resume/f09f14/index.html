company: Netflix
reason1: I like to test code in the truest sense of the word.  Not only should it be correct, but it should be efficient and robust.  Automated tests make fast iterations that consistently improve software possible
reason2: I enjoy designing and implementing distributed systems. That includes everything from architecting fault-tolerant, asynchronous services to researching the latest in lock-free data structures
reason3: If I had a motto, "Automate everything" would be a serious contender.  Netflix is the kind of company that fully embraces this idea, and is aligned with how I think about software
