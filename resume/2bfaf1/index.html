title: Resume
layout: resume-ui
hash: 2bfaf1
company: Woven
reason1: I have a passion for software, and view developing it as a craft. I strongly believe in meritocracy, and will debate anything to find the best ideas
reason2: I enjoy working on the full stack, diving into everything from the kernel to CSS. I'm not afraid of jumping into other people's code, fixing bugs, and submitting them back upstream
reason3: If I had a motto, "Automate everything" would be a serious contender.  Woven is the kind of company that fully embraces this idea, and is aligned with how I think about software
