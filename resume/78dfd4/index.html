reason1: I have a passion for software, and view developing it as a craft. I strongly believe in meritocracy, and will debate anything to find the best ideas
reason2: API design is my tech drug.  I live by the ideals of REST and making complex tasks simple.  API's should be like good wine: simple and fun to the inexperienced with hidden subtly and power(ful flavors) for the expert
reason3: I enjoy designing and implementing distributed systems. That includes everything from architecting fault-tolerant, asynchronous services to researching the latest in lock-free data structures
