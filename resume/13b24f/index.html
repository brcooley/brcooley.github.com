company: Agile Diagnosis
reason1: I like to test code in the truest sense of the word.  Not only should it be correct, but it should be efficient and robust.  Automated tests make fast iterations that consistently improve software possible
reason2: API design is my tech drug.  I live by the ideals of REST and making complex tasks simple.  API's should be like good wine: simple and fun to the inexperienced with hidden subtly and power(ful flavors) for the expert
reason3: I want to change the world using software.  Agile Diagnosis is a place where I can try to do just that full-time, bettering the lives of millions of people along the way
