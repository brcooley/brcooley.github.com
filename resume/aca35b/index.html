reason1: I enjoy working on the full stack, diving into everything from the kernel to CSS. I'm not afraid of jumping into other people's code, fixing bugs, and submitting them back upstream
reason2: I have a passion for software, and view developing it as a craft. I strongly believe in meritocracy, and will debate anything to find the best ideas
reason3: I like to test code in the truest sense of the word.  Not only should it be correct, but it should be efficient and robust.  Automated tests make fast iterations that consistently improve software possible
