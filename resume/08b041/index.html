reason1: I am driven by a desire to design, implement, test, and scale elegant and effective code.  This is something that applies to every project, regardless of language or size
reason2: I have a passion for software, and view developing it as a craft. I strongly believe in meritocracy, and will debate anything to find the best ideas
reason3: I enjoy working on the full stack, diving into everything from the kernel to CSS. I'm not afraid of jumping into other people's code, fixing bugs, and submitting them back upstream
