company: FullContact
reason1: I have a passion for software, and view developing it as a craft. I strongly believe in meritocracy, and will debate anything to find the best ideas
reason2: API design is my tech drug.  I live by the ideals of REST and making complex tasks simple.  API's should be like good wine: simple and fun to the inexperienced with hidden subtly and power(ful flavors) for the expert
reason3: Colorado is my true home, and getting the chance to be a part of the budding tech scene in Denver would be a dream come true
